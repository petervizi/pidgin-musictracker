ChangeLog for MusicTracker Pidgin Plugin
========================================

2008-09-22 (Version 0.4.10)
	* Fix terrible bug introduced by change for issue #32, which utterly broke tune status support (issue #36)

2008-09-22 (Version 0.4.9)
	* Update configure check for dbus-glib to 0.73, needed for dbus_g_proxy_call_with_timeout
	* Fix /nowplaying to get correct information when status changing is disabled (issue #32)
	* Fix a problem with the msn compatability message handler which behaved badly when Winamp had stopped in auto-detect mode
	* Avoid a crash mode in winamp message handling seen with musikCube (due to it's limited Winamp compatibilty interface)
	* Fix crash with audacious caused by a rather obvious mistake (issue #28, #33)
	* Audit uses of G_TYPE_STRING returned from a dbus call and fix a couple of leaks
	* Make MPRIS player detection fully dynamic, scanning for org.mpris.* service names; add an additional hint needed for dragonplayer to work
	* Generalize MSN message support a little bit more
	* Avoid a potential null dereference in xmms2 debug output
	* Rewrite MPRIS debug code to avoid use of GHashTableIter, so we work with all GLib > 2.0.0, and so don't have a different GLib dependency to pidgin itself

2008-09-10 (Version 0.4.8)
	* Add patch from Phillip Camp for SqueezeCenter/SlimServer support 
	* Fix a crash which could occur if an account is added whilst musictracker is loaded
	* Add a fallback method for getting track information by catching messages intended to pass that info to MSN Messenger
	* Fix foobar2000 title parsing for the case where the track has no album information
	* Add MPRIS-complaint player track information support

2008-09-01 (Version 0.4.7)
	* Correct the way we retrieve track artist info from WMP (#16)
	* Fix a problem where tune status could sometimes get left with stale data (e.g. if player was closed whilst pidgin was closed)
	* Apply patch from hyperair adding a timeout to dbus calls, so they cannot block indefinitely (hanging pidgin) if something has gone wrong in the target application (#13)
	* Fix restoring saved status so it correctly restores account-specific saved status (#11)
	* Attempt to avoid being told "MSN: Friendly name changes too rapidly" when player is stopped
	* Some more tidying up
	* Update libmpdclient to latest svn (revision 7402) (this fixes a file descriptor leak when an IPv6-enabled MPD is running) (#137, maybe #12?)
	* Enable MPD client in windows build
	* Fix type conversion warnings when building for x64 (#18)
	* Use dopen/dlsym to access XMMS2 client library, so it doesn't become a run-time dependency if we build with XMM2 support enabled

2008-08-22 (Version 0.4.6)
	* Rewrite WMP support using disphelper from http://disphelper.sourceforge.net/ and WMPuICE by Christian Mueller from http://www.mediatexx.com
	* Restore support for non-widechar Winamp interface, as a fall-back if preferred interface fails

2008-08-07 (Version 0.4.5)
	* Various fixes to avoid crash modes where track information is longer than expected
	* Compilation warnings fixes
	* Improve foobar2000 and winamp interface code to work better for track info using east asian characters
	* Do PCRE_STATIC properly (only applies to windows builds and tells us to use a static library)
	* Improve last.fm feed interface: infer player is off if scrobble timestamp is older than a configurable interval, configure polling interval as well
	* Add some possibly needed pcre_free()s

2008-08-01 (Version 0.4.4) "I suppose I should fix that...."
	* Store musictracker per-account preferences using both screen name and protocol as the key,
		so that multiple accounts with the same screen name on different protocols may have different setttings (#2)
	* Strip windows DLL before making installer (so it's not huge!) (#4)
	* Restore UI selected status when musictracker is unloaded (#114)
	* Fix tune status support to work with msn, coming in purple 2.5.0,
		add UI to disable personal message changing if we have tune status (#3)
	* Add ability to disable status changing whilst away
	* Add a simple implementation of a "/nowplaying" or "/np" command
	* Fix way amarok and iTunes interface code deals with times greater than 60 minutes (#22)
	* Fix exaile interface code to retrieve current position in track correctly (was broken!)
	* Tidy up some debug output and general cruft
	* Add a bit of defensive code against a possible crash (#5)

	* Rhythmbox: Slightly improve the way we report information for streams (#35), based on a patch by eemil.lagerspetz

		(#39), based on a patch by TorresMAT
	* Winamp: don't screw up titles which contain hyphens, try to still do something useful with streams (#59)
	        based on a patch by leonardo.monteiro.fernandes
	* amarok: Check for running dcopserver to avoid problems when dcop blocks for long enough that we appear to hang pidgin (#68),
		Don't spam stderr with "call failed" errors from trying to dcop amarok
        * Add missing header include to fix Gentoo QA notice on build (#138)
	
2008-07-10 (Version 0.4.2 unofficial)
	* Fix finding window for Foobar2000 0.9.5.3 and later
	* Don't crash if track info from player isn't valid UTF-8!
	* Get UTF-8 track info from iTunes and WMP

	* If the track info message is empty, try to restore the status message selected in UI (e.g. for when your player stopped message is empty)
